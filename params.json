{"name":"modelmodel","tagline":"Analyze and simulate (model-based) fMRI in python","body":"`modelmodel` is a python package for *creating programs* to do detailed, and if we're optimistic, quantitative analyses of BOLD timecourses - real and simulated. \r\n\r\nThe focus is on model-based (i.e. parametric) designs.\r\n\r\nIt is still *very much* a work in progress.\r\n\r\nThe great work of [statsmodel](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/devel/index.html) project and especially [patsy](http://patsy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) made this package possible and powerful.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI've written the analysis tool I have always wanted.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically:\r\n\r\n* To seamlessly intermix real and simulated BOLD data, allowing for detailed analysis and assumption testing.\r\n* Designed to make specifying a model-based design trivial; It's the only simulation environment focused on model-based designs\r\n* If you need to integrate computational model parameter fits, it can do that too.\r\n* Has builtin access to over 500 anatomical ROIs from 8 separate atlases.\r\n* It's trivial to add your own (functional) ROIs.\r\n* Model-comparison is the default approach, with AIC the favored statistic.  But BIC, F-values, and other others are supported. \r\n* It's very easy to swap in sophisticated regression techniques in place of OLS. Any regression method from statsmodels will do.\r\n* It's the only fMRI simulation environment for the python programming language, as least as far as I am aware (if this is wrong, please let me know). *Note*: There are very nice systems for R (neuRosim) and MATLAB (simTB  - which looks quite fantastic these days).\r\n* Designed as a programmer's analysis package first. I wanted a clean but powerful and pythonic way to do a fMRI analysis. So that is what I tried to write.\r\n\r\nThat said, I really hope it is useful to you.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is not a beginners tool.\r\n\r\n- I expect you have a solid grasp of fMRI analysis methods.\r\n- I expect you can program in python.\r\n- I expect you can preprocess the data elsewhere. Data must be in Nifti1 (and MNI152/352 space, to use the ROI features).\r\n\r\nIf any of these expectations are not met, you are going to have a bad time.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
